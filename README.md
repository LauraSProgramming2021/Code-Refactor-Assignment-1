# Code-Refactor-Assignment-1
This is the repository for my first Bootcamp assignment: "01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor".

The originally provided webpage (.html file) did not meet accessibility standards. So, I modified the .html file to make this project meet accessibiltiy standards. Now, this page is accessible to all users who can, therefore, benefit from it.

I learned and/or implemented the following:
* I added semantic HTML elements throughout the file, as-appropriate.
* I structured the HTML elements logically, independently from styling and positioning.
* I added accessible alt attributes to all images.
* I fixed the heading attributes by implementing them in sequential order.
* I fixed the title element by adding a descriptive title to the page.

Additionally:
* I added comments throughout the .html file to explain what each main section was for and/or how it worked.
* I added a descriptive heading 2 to the right-hand side bar.
* I made certain that there were no form controls that needed labels. (A common accessibility issue.)
* I verified that there were no image maps that needed fixing. (A common accessibility issue.)
* I verified that there were no tables that were made improperly. (A common accessibility issue.)
* I validated the .html file with https://validator.w3.org/nu/, made a few changes.
* I validated the .css and, since it passed validation, I added the code for the valid CSS icon at the bottom of the .html page from W3C.
